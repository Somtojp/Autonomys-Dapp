# Autonomys Validator Agent (dapp)

## Overview
The **Autonomys Validator Agent** is a decentralized AI-powered validator assistant designed to enhance **network security, governance participation, and staking efficiency** within the Autonomys Network. It ensures optimal validator performance, prevents centralization, and enhances **on-chain governance** using the Autonomys framework.

## Features
âœ… **Automated Validator Node Management** â€“ Ensures high uptime and performance for validators.  
âœ… **Security & Anomaly Detection** â€“ Monitors network activity to detect potential risks and attacks.  
âœ… **On-Chain Governance Participation** â€“ Engages in governance proposals and educates validators.  
âœ… **Decentralized Reputation System** â€“ Uses Autonomys Networkâ€™s storage for validator ranking & performance transparency.  
âœ… **Optimized Staking Rewards** â€“ Ensures fair participation by analyzing validator contributions.  

## How It Works
1. **AI-Powered Validator Insights** â€“ The agent continuously tracks validator performance and suggests improvements.
2. **Automated Security Alerts** â€“ It detects suspicious activity and reports anomalies in real time.
3. **On-Chain Governance Integration** â€“ The agent interacts with governance proposals and relays updates to validators.
4. **Autonomys Network Integration** â€“ Validator data is stored securely on the Autonomys Network for transparency and decentralization.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- Yarn package manager
- Taurus EVM wallet with funds (for on-chain storage)
- Autonomys SDK

### Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/autonomys-validator-agent.git
   cd autonomys-validator-agent
2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   ```sh
   yarn install
3. **Create Validator Agent Configuration::**  
   ```sh
   yarn create-character autonomys_validator
4. Update Environment Variables:
Add your Taurus EVM Private Key and Contract Address in the .env file.
Set AUTO_DRIVE_API_KEY to store validator performance on-chain.

5. **Run the Validator Agent:**  
   ```sh
     yarn start autonomys_validator
